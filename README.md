# 🚀 Rust Minimals - A Incomplete Collection of Short Rust Code Snippets for Quick Re-entry

Welcome to **Rust Minimale**! 🌱

This is a growing collection of **short, minimal Rust code snippets** designed to help you quickly re-engage with Rust. Whether you're looking to brush up on reference handling, rediscover the magic of lifetimes, or quickly recall a `Result` pattern, this collection is here to guide you back into the Rust game.

## Contributing

Feel free to add your own minimal snippets if you have something in mind! This is a work in progress and is **intentionally non-sequential** for now. The idea is to grow this collection organically and improve it over time.

In the future, the plan is to better organize and document the snippets. One potential goal is to create a **dependency graph** to find the optimal learning paths for beginners and experienced Rustaceans alike. This might evolve as the Rust ecosystem grows and addresses current challenges, like those discussed by the **Linux kernel developers** regarding `panic` handling, or the ongoing debates about **micro-dependencies** in the Rust community.

### Why Rust?

Rust is still evolving rapidly, and while it's already becoming more prominent, there’s still a lot to figure out. Should I feel that Rust gains even more prominence (and it likely will), this repo will grow and mature as well. Stay tuned! 🚀

## What's Next?

For now, no structured, book-like sequencing has been imposed. The snippets are simple, isolated pieces, aimed at providing quick help and insight into common Rust patterns and tricks.

### Wanna Dig in?

You're invited to grab a shovel and help out in this growing construction site 🛠️! We can build something great together. Let's make Rust learning and re-learning easy and fun!
